PROJECT SHOPPING CART

Project shopping cart is a site where one can buy baked goods. 

To use this site scroll and find which baked goods you want to buy and put them in the cart, make sure to check out!

JavaScript is for the functionality of the page such as being able to reflect changes in quantity and total price when pressing the buttons like Update Cart or Remove [x] item.
